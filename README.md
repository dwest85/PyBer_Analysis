# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
* This analysis was performed on behalf of Pyber to gain insight into the weekly fare sales seperated into city types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). A line-graph visualization was also created to help Pyber make future financial decisions based on the values pulled from city and ride raw data.

# Results
* Based on the results, the Rural ride fares had the largest dollar amount per ride. However, the Urban total fare sales greatly outweighed both Rural and Suburban amounts based on the daily and weekly volumes. 

* The table below shows the Average Fare breakdown, which the Rural rides greatly outweight the other two city types.

# Summary
* Based on the results, I recommend improving the marketing presence in the Rural city areas, as the high dollar value per ride and low total fare shelf creates opportunity for improving upon the overall fare sales between all three city types.

* From January to March, the Urban sales improve by almost $1000 USD, which shows an opportunity of improvement in the colder months for the Urban areas. We should also improve marketing opportunities for the Urban area around this time frame.

* In March, the suburban city areas had $1500 USD sales, which shows the value of opportunity for this area. However, April was a low point for the suburban city types. I recommend increasing the marketing during this time frame to help build fare sales.
